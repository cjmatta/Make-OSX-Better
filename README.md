Make OSX Better 
===============  
(for technical folks who use a lot of commandline tools)

Tools that should be installed to make life on OSX more productive and even more intuitive. 

##Terminal  
OSX Terminal sucks (feature wise), I'm used to [terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator) for Linux - You can easily do split screen (right click 'Split pane Vertically' or 'Horizontally') with iTerm2, an send commands to all panes at the same time (right click 'Toggle broadcast input'):

##Linux/Unix tools
Tons of familiar GNU tools missing from OSX, install homebrew then install packages like 'coreutils', wget, vim (GNU vim).

[The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) - Like ack, and much much faster.

##Text Editor
Syntax highlighting, tabs, the works.  And comes with a number of color schemes that can make staring at code much easier on the eyes.

##Screen keep awake  
Caffeine keeps your computer from going to sleep while you are simply watching a video or training or doing a presentation.

##Window Snapping
Window snapping should be in every GUI by default, but OSX requires a tool.  Don't configure anything, just install it and have it startup by default:

What to I mean by "Window snapping"?  It's not screenshots, see here:

##Click on date/time and see the calendar
Novel idea right?  Apple doesn't seem to think so (Even on Yosemite).
