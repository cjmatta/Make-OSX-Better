Make OSX Better 
===============  
(for technical folks who use a lot of commandline tools)

Tools that should be installed to make life on OSX more productive and even more intuitive. 


OSX Terminal sucks (feature wise), I'm used to terminator for Linux - You can easily do split screen (right click 'Split pane Vertically' or 'Horizontally') with iTerm2, an send commands to all panes at the same time (right click 'Toggle broadcast input'):

Tons of familiar GNU tools missing from OSX, install homebrew then install packages like 'coreutils', wget, vim (GNU vim).

Screen snapping should be in every GUI by default, but OSX requires a tool.  Don't configure anything, just install it and have it startup by default:

What to I mean by "Screen snapping"?  It's not screenshots, see here:
